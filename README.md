# READ ME BEFORE MOVING ONWARD
Package is under heavy development and not ready for release, Package is complete and working. I am just working on all of the bugs and perfecting it before I release. At the time there is no install guide. Will be soon though! Make sure you watch!

# Laravel Permission System
This system is a fork of spatie/laravel-permission, that adds a large amount of features and uses heavy pseudo code. 

# Why Fork and not jsut contribute? 
This fork/branch has breaking changes that would absolutely disrupt the original package. Also, this package has adavanced useages that are not simple and most likely will not be used by most.
